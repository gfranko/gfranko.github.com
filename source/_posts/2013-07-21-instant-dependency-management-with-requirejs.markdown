In May 2013, Packt Publishing published my Require.js book, [Instant Dependency Management with RequireJS](http://www.packtpub.com/dependency-management-with-requirejs-how-to/book).  This book is perfect for intermediate to advanced JavaScript developers who are interested in learning more about AMD and Require.js.
